# blog_Unlocking-Cybersecurity

Welcome to my repository where you will find my code and notes on securing a login page using python.

* Terminal Login
  This is a simple project asking a user to put in a password. The program will validate the users input. After three incorrect attempts give an error message.
  Vulnerabilities:
  - Password saved in code
  - Username Enumeration
  - Weak Password
